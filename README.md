# Moodle Session Manager for Safari (Apple)

Moodle has the problem that it stores the login only in the session which is deleted when closing Safari. 

This tool lets you save the **MoodleSession** cookie and restore it if you open moodle again.

## TODO's

- [ ] Create Logo for Extension
- [ ] Make buttons colorful (+ icons?)
- [ ] Test on other moodels (ETH, etc.)
- [ ] Publish on AppStore
