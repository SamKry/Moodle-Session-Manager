# Moodle Session Manager for Safari (Apple)

Moodle has the problem that it stores the login only in the session which is deleted when closing Safari. 

This tool lets you save the **MoodleSession** cookie and restore it if you open moodle again.

## TODO's

- [ ] Create Logo for Extension
- [ ] Make buttons colorful (+ icons?)
- [ ] Show Sucess messag in buttons (like checkmark on save/restore)
- [ ] Test on other moodels (ETH, etc.)
- [ ] Publish on AppStore

## Open for discussion

Is there a way to automate the save action so that you dont have to do it manualy?
